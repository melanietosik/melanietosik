### 👋 Hi, I'm Melanie

I'm a data lead, manager, and staff data scientist based in Brooklyn, NY.

I'm currently at BuzzFeed where I've worked on a bunch of different teams and projects now, most notably:

- **Apps**: improved our personalization models and feed ranking algorithms
- **Infra**: designed a new API to generate article embeddings in real-time and improve load time for related content recommendations
- **Commerce**: built an entirely new system to store and retrieve similar products based on image embeddings
- **RevTech**: actively working on improved audience segmentation and targeting to drive more effective ad campaigns
- **GenAI**: launched a number of first-to-market ChatGPT plug-ins and chatbots that are live on our site

Here's what a typical workday looks like for me:

### 🏛 History

#### 👩‍💻 Experience

I've been at BuzzFeed for 4 years (plus an internship the year prior to joining full-time). Before moving to New York I worked at a travel AI startup in Austin, where I was part of a small team of NLP researchers and engineers. I had a brief stint consulting at Underdog.io as well, and some previous internships in recruiting.

#### 👩‍🎓 Education

I got my MS in computer science from NYU. For my undergrad I studied NLP at the University of Potsdam (near Berlin).

### ⁉️ FAQ

- **Q:** Can you help me become a data scientist? **A:** Maybe! I'm happy to answer specific questions, but it's very, very difficult to give generic career advice in this field. I picked up a new book called _Build a Career in Data Science_ by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis last year and it's a great resource, so I'd recommend you start there.
- **Q:** Book recs? **A:** All time favorites: _The Book Thief_ and _When Breath Becomes Air_. Currently reading: _The Impossible City_ by Karen Cheung and _The Sandman_ graphic novels by Neil Gaiman.
- **Q:** What is that accent? **A:** It's German. One day I'm going to hire a voice coach to help me iron out my R's.
