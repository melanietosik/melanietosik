### 👋 Hi, I'm Melanie

I'm a data scientist/ML engineer based in New York.

I currently work on building personalized ranking and recommendation systems at Grubhub.

Here's what a typical workday looks like for me:

### 🏛 History

#### 👩‍💻 Experience

I joined Grubhub in September 2024. Previously, I spent 5 years at BuzzFeed, where I touched on everything from ML infra to feed ranking, audience segmentation, generative AI, and of course more recommender systems. Before moving to New York I worked at a travel AI startup in Austin, TX. I also had a brief stint consulting at Underdog.io, and some previous internships as well as some teaching assistant roles at NYU.

#### 👩‍🎓 Education

I got my MS in Computer Ccience from NYU. For my undergrad I studied NLP at the University of Potsdam (near Berlin).

### ⁉️ FAQ

- **Q:** Can you help me become a data scientist? **A:** Maybe! I'm happy to answer specific questions, but it's very, very difficult to give generic career advice in this field. I picked up this book called _Build a Career in Data Science_ by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis a few years ago and it's a great resource, so I'd still recommend you start there.
- **Q:** Book recs? **A:** All time favorites: _The Book Thief_ and _When Breath Becomes Air_. Currently reading: _The Impossible City_ by Karen Cheung and _The Sandman_ graphic novels by Neil Gaiman.
- **Q:** What is that accent? **A:** It's German. One day I'm going to hire a voice coach to help me iron out my R's.
